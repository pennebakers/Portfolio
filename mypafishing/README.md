# MyPaFishing App

-My thought behind this app was an app to help people in state and out of state find fishing locations open to the public throughout the state <br />
-Another thought is hosting online tournaments becasue a big thing that covid has taken away competively is the aspect of tournament fishing for cash prizes.
Having the contestants upload multiple pictures of size and weight would be able to help determine the winners of these contests.
